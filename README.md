# BirthdayFireworks
Muck around with unity and fireworks, celebrating my b-day bro's birthday!  

**Happy Birthday Reuben!!**

## Instructions
Once running there are a few controls:
- Right Click and drag to rotate the camea (have a look around, it seems like someone may have come to join in the festivities!)
- Scroll Wheel to zoom in and out
- Left Click to set off your own fireworks
- Esc key to exit

## Learning
Key points of development for my second project;
1. Use of VFX Graph (thanks Brackeys)
2. Camera Collision control (although it is still a bit funky)
3. Blender (first time play)
4. Unity Terrain
5. Spatial Sounds

## Copyright
Other than using a bunch of free sources, the John Williams and the Cantina Band were ripped from youtube... from someone else who also probably didnt have copyright permissions :)
